## How to Use

### Getting Started
1. Navigate to the "AI Chat" tab in the app

### Example Prompts
- "I need to buy groceries tomorrow"
- "Create a high priority task to finish the project by Friday"
- "I want to exercise 3 times this week"
- "Remind me to call the dentist next week"
- "I have a meeting with the client on Monday at 2pm"
- "I need to buy groceries, call the dentist, and finish my project" (creates 3 todos)
- "I want to learn Spanish this year" (creates a goal with milestones)
- "I have a big project with research, design, and implementation phases" (creates a goal with 3 milestones)

### Quick Actions
The chat interface includes quick action buttons for common todo types:
- Grocery shopping
- Project deadlines
- Exercise goals
- Appointment reminders

### Creating Todos & Goals
1. Type your request in the chat or use voice recording
2. The AI will analyze your message and extract relevant details
3. A preview of the todos/goals will appear in the chat
4. Click "Create Todo" or "Create Goal" to add them to your list
5. The items will appear in the main Todos/Goals tabs

**Multiple Items:**
- When you mention multiple tasks, the AI creates separate todos
- Complex projects are broken down into multiple related todos
- Goals with milestones create structured project plans
- All items can be created with a single click

### Voice Recording
1. Tap the üé§ button next to the text input
2. Speak your todo request clearly
3. Tap "Stop Recording" when finished
4. The AI will process your voice and create a todo
5. Review and confirm the created todo

**Mobile Platforms (iOS/Android):**
- Audio files are sent directly to the AI API for processing
- Uses OpenAI Whisper for accurate transcription
- No reliance on device-specific speech recognition
- More reliable than built-in voice recognition
